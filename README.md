## Story

Last week you made great progress improving your web application.
We need some more features to make it more usable and more appealing to users.

The users requested new features, such as the ability to register and login.
There are a few other feature requests which you can find in the user stories.

The management wants you to separate the already working features from
the upcoming ones, so your development team need to **start using branching
workflow and open new branches for the features you start in this sprint**.
Just like last week, the ownership is in your hands. There are no compulsory stories,
but of course, management would prefer if all stories were implemented.
So first, choose the stories, then ask a mentor to validate your choice.

Just like last week, you have a **prioritized list** of new user stories that you should
add to the unfinished stories from last week on your product backlog. Try to
estimate these new stories as well, and, based on the estimations, decide how many
your team can finish until the demo. As the order is important, you choose
from the beginning of the list as much as you can.
